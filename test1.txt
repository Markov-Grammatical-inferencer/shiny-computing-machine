Hello world.
Goodbye Joe.
Where are you?
Why are you?
Where are we?
Beyond the void in which our minds did seek refuge while we sought out
the message in the madness.
The boy runs.
The boy runs home.
The boy runs home quickly.
The boy runs home very quickly.
The blue boy runs home because he is blue.
